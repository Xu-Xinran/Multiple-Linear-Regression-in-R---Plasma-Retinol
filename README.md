# Multiple-Linear-Regression-in-R---Plasma-Retinol-and-Beta-Carotene
In this study, a cross-sectional data was used to investigate the relationship between personal characteristics, dietary factors, and plasma concentrations of retinol and beta-carotene. 

Study subjects were 276 patients who had an elective surgical procedure during a three-year period to biopsy or remove a lesion of the lung, colon, breast, skin, ovary or uterus that was found to be non-cancerous.

The main objective of this study is to use multiple linear regression model to find out what factors influence beta-carotene levels and retinol levels in human plasma respectively, and maybe further inspire scientists to evaluate the internal factors that may have some effect or relationship with the beta-carotene and retinol in plasma level.
